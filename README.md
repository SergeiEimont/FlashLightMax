# FlashLightMax
FlashLightMax project from App Development with Swift curriculum 2022

The FlashLightMax application can work in three modes: black and white, multicolor (red, yellow and green colors are added) and the mode of operation of the flash built into the device.
There are three buttons on the program screen, each of which corresponds to its own mode.
